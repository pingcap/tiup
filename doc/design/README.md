# TiUp design docs

This folder contains documentation on the current and future design of TiUp.
For our current status on design issues, see this [project](https://github.com/pingcap/tiup/projects/3).

Some important issues we should cover:

* [Requirements and goals](requirements.md)
* The [manifest format and server-side file layout](manifest.md)
* Testing strategy ([project](https://github.com/pingcap/tiup/projects/2))
* Support for overriding components with local versions (e.g., built from source).
* Local mirrors
* Components (which components we hope to support and what their CLI will look like)
* Component API (for supporting custom components)
* Code design
