#
# Environment Variables
#
#   SPARK_WORKER_INSTANCES  The number of worker instances to run on this
#                           slave.  Default is 1.
#   SPARK_WORKER_PORT       The base port number for the first worker. If set,
#                           subsequent workers will increment this number.  If
#                           unset, Spark will find a valid port number, but
#                           with no guarantee of a predictable pattern.
#   SPARK_WORKER_WEBUI_PORT The base port for the web interface of the first
#                           worker.  Subsequent workers will increment this
#                           number.  Default is 8081.
