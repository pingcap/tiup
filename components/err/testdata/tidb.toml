description = '''In versions before 3.0.8, TiDB implements the optimistic transaction mode by default, in which the transaction commit might fail because of transaction conflict. To make sure that the commit succeeds, you need to modify the application andad an automatic retry mechanism. You can avoid this issue by using the pessimistic transaction mode of TiDB.'''
workaround = '''To apply the pessimistic transaction mode, choose any of the following three methods that suits your needs:
- Execute the `BEGIN PESSIMISTIC;` statement to allow the transaction to apply the pessimistic transaction mode. You can write it in comment style as `BEGIN /*!90000 PESSIMISTIC */;` to make it compatible with the MySQL syntax.

- Execute the `set @@tidb_txn_mode = 'pessimistic';` statement to allow all the explicit transactions (namely non-autocommit transactions) processed in this session to apply the pessimistic transaction mode.

- Execute the `set @@global.tidb_txn_mode = 'pessimistic';` statement to allow all newly created sessions of the entire cluster to apply the pessimistic transaction mode to execute explicit transactions.
After you set `global.tidb_txn_mode` to `pessimistic`, the pessimistic transaction mode is applied by default. To apply the optimistic transaction mode to the transaction, you can use any of the following three methods:

- Execute the `BEGIN OPTIMISTIC;` statement to allow the transaction to apply the optimistic transaction mode. You can write it in comment style as `BEGIN /*!90000 OPTIMISTIC */;` to make it compatible with the MySQL syntax.

- Execute the `set @@tidb_txn_mode = 'optimistic';` statement to allow all the transactions processed in this session to apply the optimistic transaction mode.

- Execute the `set @@global.tidb_txn_mode = 'optimistic;'` or `set @@global.tidb_txn_mode = '';` to allow all newly created sessions of the entire cluster to apply the optimistic transaction mode to the transactions.

The `BEGIN PESSIMISTIC;` and `BEGIN OPTIMISTIC;` statements take precedence over the `tidb_txn_mode` system variable. Transactions started with these two statements ignore the system variable and support using both the pessimistic and optimistic transaction modes.
To disable the pessimistic transaction mode, modify the configuration file and add `enable = false` to the `[pessimistic-txn]` category.'''
